# Description

Under data/satimage_wrongly_scaled.vec we have the wrongly scaled data (basically
all the data returned to interval 0-255 - hopefully)

Use that file as vector file and the default values to train the map.


*NOTE*: Neighborhood radius and cluster connections did not work at all.
We have to try it with Gent's PC
