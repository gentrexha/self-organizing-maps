We used a 80x80 map size as a large map (basically one unit per input vector).


A sigma of 4 for small radius, and a sigma of 0.1 for large radius


For these kind of large maps, some of the visualizations (e.g. Minimum spanning tree,
flow borderline and some others) took too long, therefore were not considered
